# Cooking with G

I created *Cooking With* G to put all my favorite recipe ideas into one, easily accessible place. I found that bookmarking pages has its limitations, for example it can only be used on devices that you have logged into, you can only see a thumbnail picture of the website, and depending on the screen size only a very small description of the saved link is visible.  
*Cooking with G* has been created with the idea of mimicking a physical cooking book, with clear large photos, links to the full recipe, instructions and the original source of the idea and it has been sectioned into clear categories with a simple navigation. 

## My plan for Cooking With G

I am new to the coding world, therefore the website is currently written in HTLM and CSS. My plan is to now learn Java and Javascript, which can then be implemented into the website the more my knowledge grows.

I want *Cooking With G* to be used by many therefore the plan will be to create a simple account for others to use. I will then have my recommended *Cooking With G* recipe page to share with others but I also want others to take control on their own individual account therefore I will create an "add recipe" and "remove recipe" page to allow users to personalize the site to their needs, just like creating their own cookbook. 

I will also create a share option within the site for other *Cooking With G* users, so people can send their new found recipes to others, sharing their cookbook just like others share pages from recipe books and magazines. 

I want the sites look to stay simple and user friendly, with only the above features to add depth to the sites.

## How to use Cooking With G

The Home Page contains a basic explanation of the website. At the moment I am the only user who can update the website. It contains a simple navigation bar, photos with hyperlinks and a carousel. This is my first release of any website, so overtime with constant learning, the website dynamics will improve but for now this is an online cooking site that holds all my go to recipes.
